    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Perfectly tender and juicey pork chops are what you will get in just 10 minutes using your air fryer <br/>
    and basic pantry ingredients. Play around with different crouton flavors for variety.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>4 (5 ounce) boneless, center cut pork chops, 1 inch thick</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cheese and garlic croutons</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Place pork chops on a plate and season both sides with Cajun seasoning.</p></li>
        <li><p>Pulse croutons in a small food processor until they have a fine consistency; transfer <br/>
               to a shallow dish. Lightly beat eggs in a separate shallow dish. Dip pork chops into eggs,<br/>
               letting excess drip off. Coat chops in crouton breading and set on a plate. Mist chops <br/>
               with cooking spray.</p></li>
               <li><p>Spray the air fryer basket with cooking spray and place chops inside, making sure to <br/>
                not overcrowd the fryer. You may have to do two batches depending on the size of <br/>
                your air fryer.</p></li>
                <li><p>Cook for 5 minutes. Flip chops and mist again with cooking spray if there are dry or <br/>
                    powdery areas. Cook 5 minutes more. Repeat with remaining chops.</p></li>
    </ol>
